            <h2>What is a Smart Factory?</h2>
            <p>A smart factory is a manufacturing environment where machines, sensors, and intelligent systems are interconnected and communicate with each other in real-time. This integration, often referred to as Industry 4.0, allows for optimized production processes, increased efficiency, and improved decision-making.</p>
            <p>Imagine a factory where every machine, from the smallest sensor to the largest robotic arm, can "talk" to each other, sharing data, identifying bottlenecks, and even predicting when they'll need maintenance. That's the essence of a smart factory.</p>

            <h3>Industry 4.0 Overview</h3>
            <p>Industry 4.0 is the ongoing transformation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices using modern smart technology. This transformation is facilitating the convergence of the physical and digital worlds, creating a more interconnected and data-driven approach to production.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, introduces new technologies that allow us to work alongside machines in highly productive ways. Industry 4.0 isn't characterized by a single technology, but by the seamless integration of a number of systems, tools, and innovations.</p>
